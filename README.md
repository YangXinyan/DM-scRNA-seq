# Data processing scripts for DM single cell RNA-seq

## Data availability
Raw sequencing data for human normal testis was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE106487 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106487). The single-cell RNA sequencing raw data from human diabetic patientsâ€™ testis in this paper have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive in National Genomics Data Center, China National Center for Bioinformation / Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GSA-Human: HRA000976) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa-human/browse/HRA000976. The HIF1A CUT&Tag raw data in this paper have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA: CRA004696) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/browse/CRA004696. The processed data in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at NCBI under accession number GSE179080 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE179080).
