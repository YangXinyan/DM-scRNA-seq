# Data processing scripts for DM single cell RNA-seq

## Data availability
Raw sequencing data for human normal testis was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE106487. The accession number for the single-cell RNA sequencing raw data from human diabetic patients’ testis in this paper is GSA (Genome Sequence Archive in BIG Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences): HRA000976 (Shared URL: https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa-human/s/464w8ge5). The accession number for the HIF1α CUT&Tag raw data in this paper is GSA: CRA004696 (Shared URL: https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/s/ed1wsS8w). The accession number for the processed data in this paper is GEO: GSE179080. The following secure token has been created to allow review of record GSE179080 while it remains in private status: wnyloiyoljofrkf.
